# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

Data hails from my SQL Course. It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

    What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?

    What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?

    What skills are most in-demand for data analysts?

    Which skills are associated with higher salaries?

    What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

    SQL: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.

    PostgreSQL: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.

    Visual Studio Code: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.

    Git & GitHub: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.


# The Analysis

Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here’s how I approached each question:
### Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs

To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT job_id,
job_title,
job_location,
job_schedule_type,
salary_year_avg,
job_posted_date,
company_dim.name as company_name
FROM job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE 
job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
salary_year_avg is NOT NULL

order by salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
